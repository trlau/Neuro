    "title": "COVID-19 Vaccinations: Summary Guidance for Cancer Patients in 28 Languages: Breaking Barriers to Cancer Patient Information",
    "abstract": "Background: Covid-19 vaccination has started in the majority of the countries at the global level. Cancer patients are at high risk for infection, serious illness, and death from COVID-19 and need vaccination guidance and support. Guidance availability in the English language only is a major limit for recommendations’ delivery and their application in the world’s population and generates information inequalities across the different populations. Methods: Most of the available COVID-19 vaccination guidance for cancer patients was screened and scrutinized by the European Cancer Patients Coalition (ECPC) and an international oncology panel of 52 physicians from 33 countries. Results: A summary guidance was developed and provided in 28 languages in order to reach more than 70 percent of the global population. Conclusion: Language barrier and e-guidance availability in the native language are the most important barriers when communicating with patients. E-guidance availability in various native languages should be considered a major priority by international medical and health organizations that are communicating with patients at the global level.",

    "title": "Guidance concerning chiropractic practice in response to COVID-19 in the U.S.: a summary of state regulators’ web-based information",
    "abstract": "Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes, as many state and local governments enacted stay-at-home orders and non-essential businesses were closed. State chiropractic licensing boards play an important role in protecting the public via regulation of licensure and provision of guidance regarding standards of practice, especially during times of change or uncertainty. Objective The purpose of this study was to summarize the guidance provided in each of the 50 United States, related to chiropractic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A review of the public facing websites of governors and state chiropractic licensing boards was conducted in the United States. Data were collected regarding the official guidance provided by each state’s chiropractic licensing board as well as the issuance of stay-at-home orders and designations of essential personnel by state governors. Descriptive statistics were used to report the findings from this project. Results Each of the 50 state governor’s websites and individual state chiropractic licensing board’s websites were surveyed. Stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders were issued in 86% of all states. Chiropractors were classified as essential providers in 54% of states, non-essential in one state (2%), and no guidance was provided in the remaining 44% of all states. Fourteen states (28%) recommended restricting visits to only urgent cases and the remaining states (72%) provided no guidance. Twenty-seven states (54%) provided information regarding protecting against infectious disease and the remaining states (46%) provided no guidance. Twenty-two states (44%) provided recommendations regarding chiropractic telehealth and the remaining states (56%) provided no guidance. Seventeen states (34%) altered license renewal requirements and eight states (16%) issued warnings against advertising misleading or false information regarding spinal manipulation and protection from COVID-19. Conclusion State guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic was heterogenous, widely variability in accessibility, and often no guidance was provided by state chiropractic licensing boards. Some state chiropractic licensing boards chose to assemble guidance for licensees into a single location, which we identified as a best practice for future situations where changes in chiropractic practice must be quickly communicated.",

    "title": "[The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China].",
    "abstract": "Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.",

    "title": "Education and Information to Improve Adherence to Screening for Breast, Colorectal, and Cervical Cancer—Lessons Learned during the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "abstract": "Simple Summary Screening for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer is correlated with diagnosis at an earlier stage, less extensive surgery, and reduced mortality and fewer complications. Adherence rates to cancer screening are lower for individuals with low socio-economic conditions and educational attainment. These social disparities are only partially reduced by free screening through national initiatives. Education and information and appropriate expenditure for preventive care have the potentials to increase adherence to screening for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer with the possibility of reduced cancer mortality. The findings of our study highlight the importance of the implementation of nationally organized screening programs for several other types of cancers that are often detected after the occurrence of symptoms. Nationally organized screening programs for several types of cancers, like esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer, in regions with a high prevalence may increase the possibility of diagnosis at earlier stages and improved early and late results. Abstract The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between adherence to cancer screening programs and earlier diagnosis of the 14 most common types of cancers in the adult population, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. National data concerning number of admissions and operations in Italy for adult patients admitted with oncologic problems during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2022) and in the pre-pandemic period (2015 to 2019) were analyzed. We selected 14 types of cancer that present the most common indications for surgery in Italy. This study included 1,365,000 adult patients who had surgery for the 14 most common types of cancer in the period 2015–2022, and interviews concerning adherence rates to screening for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer were conducted for 133,455 individuals. A higher decrease in the number of operations for the 14 types of cancer (−45%) was registered during the first three acute phases of the pandemic, and it was more evident for screenable cancers like breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer (p < 0.001). During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of screened individuals for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer decreased by 33.8% (from 7,507,893 to 4,969,000) and the number of diagnoses and operations for these three types of cancer decreased by 10.5% (from 107,656 to 96,405). The increase and return to normality of the number of screened individuals in the last year of the pandemic (2022) and in the first post-pandemic year (2023) was associated with a return to the pre-pandemic levels of diagnoses and operations. The adherence rates were lower for individuals living in rural areas, with low socio-economic status, and unmarried persons; however, the most statistically significant factor for reduced adherence was a lower level of educational attainment. Free screening through nationally organized programs reduced social disparities. There were no significant differences between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods for several types of cancers (stomach, esophagus, pancreas, liver) that are diagnosed for the occurrence of symptoms and for which nationally organized programs might increase the possibility of earlier diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes. Education, information, and appropriate expenditure for preventive care have the potential to reduce cancer mortality. Nationally organized screening programs for several types of cancers, which are often detected for the occurrence of symptoms, may increase the possibility of diagnosis at earlier stages.",

    "title": "Long-Term Care Resident Health and Quality of Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Synthesis Analysis of Canadian Institute for Health Information Data Tables",
    "abstract": "Objective: Long-term care (LTC) homes (“nursing homes”) were challenged during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on resident admission and discharge rates, resident health attributes, treatments, and quality of care. Design: Synthesis analysis of “Quick Stats” standardized data table reports published yearly by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. These reports are a pan-Canadian scorecard of LTC services rendered, resident health characteristics, and quality indicator performance. Setting and participants: LTC home residents in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario, Canada that were assessed with the interRAI Minimum Data Set 2.0 comprehensive health assessment in fiscal years 2018/2019, 2019/2020 (pre-pandemic period), and 2020/2021 (pandemic period). Methods: Risk ratio statistics were calculated to compare admission and discharge rates, validated interRAI clinical summary scale scores, medication, therapy and treatment provision, and seventeen risk-adjusted quality indicator rates from the pandemic period relative to prior fiscal years. Results: Risk of dying in the LTC home was greater in all provinces (risk ratio [RR] range 1.10 to 1.29) during the pandemic. Quality of care worsened substantially on 6 of 17 quality indicators in British Columbia and Ontario, and 2 quality indicators in Manitoba and Alberta. The only quality indicator where performance worsened during the pandemic in all provinces was the percentage of residents that received antipsychotic medications without a diagnosis of psychosis (RR range 1.02 - 1.16). Conclusions and implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled numerous areas to strengthen LTC and ensure that resident’s physical, social, and psychological needs are addressed during public health emergencies. Except an increase in potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use, this provincial-level analysis indicates that most aspects of resident care were maintained during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "title": "Reflection and Foresight on Personal Information Protection and Optimization in Public Health Emergencies in China—From the Perspective of Personal Information Collection during the Period of China’s Dynamic-Zero COVID-19 Prevention and Control Policy",
    "abstract": "Public health emergencies threaten the overall public health security of the country. Based on the need to control the ways of infection, the collection and processing of personal information by the government have become an important part of epidemic prevention and control. However, personal information related to the epidemic is highly sensitive, which contains other personal information and even private information in addition to information on personal health. In the early days of China’s response to the public health emergency of COVID-19, a great deal of non-desensitized information was transmitted in an unaccredited manner. With the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures, the collection and processing of personal information in China have gradually transited from the initial disorder and chaos to the current orderly, legal, and effective situation, continuously optimizing the processing paths of personal information. Serious summary and reflection on the optimization path of China’s epidemic-related information collection and processing methods by looking for a border at which the way and scope of personal information disclosure in future major public health emergencies are compatible with its purpose and role may help to improve the development of China’s personal information protection legal system from a long-term perspective.",

    "title": "Access to Information, and Concerns, Myths and Truths about Food Safety during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Overview of the Portuguese Population",
    "abstract": "Simple Summary The COVID-19 pandemic raised questions and concerns about the possibility of the virus being transmitted through food, as the virus was found in sewage, shrimps and packages of frozen food. Due to the emerging need for information on SARS-CoV-2 as a novel virus, the media played an important role in disseminating information related to the hypothesis of food-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which could have led to different public reactions related to food consumption and hygiene, food safety, and food supply chains. Identifying and understanding the main doubts and concerns about food hygiene and safety raised by the Portuguese population during the first wave of COVID-19 is important in order to understand whether these issues have influenced their practices and what lessons can be learnt for food safety and hygiene education. It was observed that the main concern expressed during this period was related to food handling due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (41.6%), and television was the main source of information used to clarify these doubts (32.9%). Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic raised questions and concerns about the possibility of the virus being transmitted through food, as the virus was found in sewage, shrimps and packages of frozen food. During the first wave of COVID-19, concerns about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through food arose. As the number of cases began to increase rapidly, so did the availability of information regarding the virus and ways to prevent infection. A significant portion of this information was disseminated by the media and the general public. Identifying and understanding the main doubts and concerns about food hygiene and safety raised by the Portuguese population during the first wave of COVID-19 is important in order to understand whether these issues have influenced their practices and what lessons can be learnt for food safety and hygiene education. The aims of this work were (1) to understand the doubts and concerns of the Portuguese population regarding food safety and hygiene during the first wave of COVID-19, and how these issues were clarified, (2) to analyze the population’s opinion on food/hygiene myths and truths related to the transmission and prevention of the infection, and (3) to understand how the first wave of COVID-19 may have influenced the population’s practices linked to food handling and consumption. The main doubts of the respondents were related to food handling (41.6%) and the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 through food (17%). Television was the main source of information used to clarify these doubts (32.9%), followed by a guideline issued by the Directorate-General of Health (30.7%). However, most respondents (50.9%) said that they had only found answers to some of their questions. Most respondents reported washing and disinfecting hands before (85% and 63.4%, respectively) and after (73.8% and 57.3%, respectively) the handling and organization of food purchases. Most respondents did not believe the myths about COVID-19 and food safety, but this depended on their level of education. Some practices may have changed as a result of the pandemic, particularly with regard to washing and disinfecting hands and food, as well as kitchen hygiene.",
